### Step 3: Deploy to Production

**Deployment Process:**
The CLI will ask you several questions:

1. **"Set up and deploy [project-path]?"** → Type `y` and press Enter

2. **"Which scope do you want to deploy to?"** → Choose your account/team

3. **"Link to existing project?"** → Type `n` (for new project) or `y` (if linking existing)

4. **"What's your project's name?"** → Press Enter to use "ray-swan-portfolio" or type a custom name

5. **"In which directory is your code located?"** → Press Enter (should be current directory)

6. **Framework Detection:**
   - Vercel will auto-detect: "Create React App"
   - Press Enter to confirm
